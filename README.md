##Overview of the Basic Calculator Project
Project Name: Basic Calculator

Objective:
The Basic Calculator project is designed to create a simple command-line application in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator accepts two numbers from the user, allows the user to select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and displays the result of the operation.

Key Features:

1. User Input:

Prompts the user to enter two numeric values.
Requests the user to select an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) to determine the operation to be performed.
2. Arithmetic Operations:

Supports four basic operations:
Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication: Computes the product of two numbers.
Division: Computes the quotient of two numbers, with error handling for division by zero.
3. Error Handling:

Division by Zero: Checks if the user attempts to divide by zero and provides an error message.
Invalid Operator: Validates the operator input and provides an error message if the input is not a recognized operator.
4. Result Display:

Formats and displays the result of the arithmetic operation clearly, including the operands, operator, and result.
Technical Details:

Programming Language: Java
Components:
Scanner: Used for reading user input from the console.
Switch Statement: Used to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's operator input.
Conditionals: Used to handle division by zero and invalid operators.
User Interaction:

The user runs the program from the command line.
The program sequentially prompts the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator.
After performing the requested operation, the result is displayed to the user.
